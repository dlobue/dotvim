This is a continuation of vimscript #182 by Gergely Kontra, who has
asked me to take over support and maintenance.  So if you have any
questions or suggestions, please direct them to me.  Please read the
description below as some enhancements have been made as well.

Description:
  This script allows you to use the tab key to do all your insert
  completion (:help ins-completion).

  Ex. To complete the word bar or baz
    foo bar baz
    b<Tab>


  This version of SuperTab supports several configuration options:
  NOTE: Please see the "Global Variables" fold in the script for more details.
  - The default completion type (defaults to keyword completion)
  - The duration that a non-default completion type will be retained before
    switching back to the default (defaults to retaining the current
    completion type until you manually kick off a different one).
  - Disabling of mid-word (word character to the left and right) completion
    (defaults to mid-word completion enabled).
  - Ability to change the default mapping to kick off forward or backward
    completion (defaults to <tab> and <s-tab>).
  - A discovery list to determine the default completion type to use for any
    given buffer (defaults to no discovery).
  - Option to highlight the first entry in the results if your completeopt has
    'menu' and 'longest'.

  This version also adds a command (:SuperTabHelp) which opens up a buffer
  listing all various completion types, where you can simply hit <enter> on
  the completion type you wish to switch to.
