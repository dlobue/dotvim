install details
If you are upgrading from the cvscommand.vim script, remove the cvscommand.vim plugin and the cvscommand.txt help file from your system before installing this version.  Also, read the CHANGES.txt file to learn about changes since cvscommand.vim.

For Vim 7:

  Unzip the installation file.
  Move the vcscommand.vim, vcscvs.vim, vcssvn.vim, vcssvk.vim, and vcsgit.vim scripts into your plugin directory.
  Move the vcscommand.txt file into your doc directory and use the ':helptags' command to add it to your help directory (:help add-local-help).

Optionally, you can move the syntax scripts into your syntax directory to get syntax highlighting of annotate result buffers.
